*** Internship Sandia ***

* Hello, my name is Keira Haskins. I am a PhD student working with Patrick Bridges at
  UNM. To start off working at Sandia, I will be working on using nvprof or 
  similar tools to analyze the performance and communication patterns of applications 
  which run on the GPU. Recently
  I have been spending time working on an MPI/CUDA based ping pong test which focuses
  on three different techniques; direct sending and recieving,
  a cuda aware method, and a method for copying data to the GPU first. From here I will
  use nvprof to analyze various methods for communication between the CPU and
  GPU on this application before moving on to larger applications, possibly FIESTA
  or HIGRAD; As an example for how we may change our communication patterns; should 
  we call pack send pack send, maybe pack pack send send, or possibly other patterns? 
  I ultimately want to be able to analyze GPU application communication patterns
  in order to determine what could be changed to improve GPU application performance.

* I've gotten my ping pong test working and I've started running it with nvprof, and
  I have since started looking at where it's spending most of its time for different
  methods.

* Ping pong test -> started working on making it more dynamic, such that I can adjust
  different parameters in it; which direction we are accessing data structures, how many
  dimensions we are looking at etc

* I've started looking at nvprof output for the ping pong test and I've started working
  on how to best make graphs of the data for bandwidth, latency, and runtime along with
  the data relating to where time is being spent in the application as output from
  nvprof.

* I've also started putting together a presentation for a meeting with Carl Pearson,
  but otherwise I don't have much more to discuss.
